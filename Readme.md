Severe weather events cause significant damage to both public health and the economy. This report analyzes the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Storm Database to identify the most harmful events in terms of fatalities, injuries, and economic consequences. The data spans from 1950 to November 2011, with more complete records in recent years. The goal is to provide insights to municipal and government managers for resource prioritization.
